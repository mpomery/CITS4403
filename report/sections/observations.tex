Choosing to attempt to implement the complex social system that is rental properties and a society that lives in them was possibly not the best idea. In the real world there are several factors that affect the price of rental properties such as age of the house, and distance to public transport, shopping centers, workplaces, schools and major population centers. People choose houses based on more than how far away it is from their current place and how much the rent is, as they look for community groups, where their friends and family live, and how many bedrooms, bathrooms and toilets it has.

The simulation does display some interesting things however. High cost rental properties start to cluster and get filled by high income earners. The further away you move from these clusters, the lower the rent and incomes become.
