\section{Implementation}

\par
- Agent based model \\
- Two agents that interact \\
- Houses and People \\
- Both act depending on the other \\

\par
- Named Tuples \\
- Good for simple data structures that we want to pass around
- Like Coordinates

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import collections

Coordinates = collections.namedtuple('Coordinates', 'x y')
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Agents}

\subsubsection{House}
\par
- Have a price and possibly an occupant \\
- Increase rent after certain amount of time \\
- Decrease rent to try and get people to rent it \\

\subsubsection{People}
\par
- Similar to real people \\
  - Have an income \\
  - Have a bank balance \\
  - Pay rent every month \\
  - Can only move when rent agreement finishes \\
- Unlike real world \\
  - No share houses \\
  - No income increases \\
  - Don't have sentience \\

\subsection{Managing the Agents}
\subsubsection{City}
\par
- Manages all the houses \\
- Makes sure rent changes \\

\subsubsection{Population}
\par
- Manages all the people \\
- Makes sure they are happy \\
- Make sure they move if they aren't \\
- Each step updates rent of old houses, moves people, then updates rent of occupied houses \\
