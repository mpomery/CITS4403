% What are agent based models? 
\par
Finding a place to live in while renting can be very difficult. Expensive places all seem to be grouped together, right next to each other and all occupied while cheaper places are on the outskirts of town and relatively empty. There are many reasons why this could be, A good way to look at a possibly reason as to why this happens is by using agent based models. These models simulate the behavior of agents in an environment. This allows us to see the overall effect of this behavior on the system.

Simulating population movements using agents is nothing new. Thomas C. Schelling's "Dynamic Models of Segregation", published in 1971, was among the first to do this. His model had two agents that both behaving the same way. They would move if they were "unhappy" because they were outnumbered by the other agent.

\par
Simulating a city of people moving around to houses with changing rent prices is harder to implement. Several variables such as rental price, occupancy and rent history need to be maintained, and a system needs to be created to determine who is going to move into each house at the end of each month, rather than randomly reassigning them.
